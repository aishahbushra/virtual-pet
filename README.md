This is my Javascript pet, named Gavin!

They can get older

As they get older, they get hungrier and less fit

I can walk Gavin to increase it's fitness. 🏃‍♂️

I can feed Gavin to decrease it's hunger. 🍕

I can can talk to Gavin to see if it needs feeding or walking

If Gavin gets too hungry or unfit, it will DIE 💀

If Gavin gets to 30 days old it will DIE 😢
